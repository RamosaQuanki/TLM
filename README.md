# TLM-Tool
This is "Text Lines Modifier Tool".

This tool contains 4 modify modules to modify lines in text files:
1. ai()
2. an()
3. ei()
4. en()

To use this tool, you need to have small knowledge in Python language, but I can explain how these 4 modules work and which variables you need to use, while creating auto-scripts, I didn't release this tool, but these modules are used in my first project "RS SDM Tool" (from my repository "Rolling-Sky-Cheating-Legends").

If you want to know how to understand this tool, then link is here: (Tutorial on developing right now)
