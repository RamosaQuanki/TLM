# TLM-Tool
This is "Text Lines Modifier Tool".

This tool contains 4 modify modules to modify lines in text files:
1. add_i()
2. add_name()
3. edit_i()
4. edit_name()

To use this tool, you need to have small knowledge in Python language, but I can explain how these 4 modules work and which variables you need to use, while creating auto-scripts, I didn't release this tool, but these modules are used in my first project "RS SDM Tool" (from my repository "Rolling-Sky-Cheating-Legends").

If you want to educate how this tool works, then read tutorial lessons
